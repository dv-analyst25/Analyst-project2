# Supply Chain Management Project

## Overview
This project is based on supply chain data. I cleaned the data using **Python (Pandas)** and performed **SQL analysis** to get useful insights like most profitable products, top suppliers, and delivery performance.

## Step 1: Data Cleaning (Python)
I used **Pandas** to clean the dataset.

### Tasks done:
- Removed missing values  
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format  
- Calculated delivery days  
- Calculated profit for each order  

**File:** `data_cleaning_supply_chain.py`

## Step 2: Data Analysis (SQL)
After cleaning, I imported the CSV file into MySQL and used SQL queries to analyze the data.

### Queries performed:
- Find top 10 most profitable products  
- Find top 5 suppliers with maximum sales  
- Find average delivery time by region  
- Find total profit by month  

**File:** `sql analysis.sql`
